MOUNT(8)                             System Administration                             MOUNT(8)

NAME
       mount - mount a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mount [-l|-h|-V]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options] device|dir

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] device dir

DESCRIPTION
       All  files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy,
       rooted at /.  These files can be spread out over several  devices.   The  mount  command
       serves  to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree.  Conversely,
       the umount(8) command will detach it again.  The filesystem is used to control how  data
       is stored on the device or provided in a virtual way by network or another services.

       The standard form of the mount command is:
